<h1>The Best Movies According to Niranjani Ramakrishnan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Shivaji the boss</h3>
<p>This movie directed by shankar, is a commercial movie yet with a social message</p>
<h3>Chandramukhi</h3>
<p>Probably on eof the very few rajini movies with a woman's name as the title. With a strong performance from all actors this thriller is sure to give you chills</p>
<h3>Baasha</h3>
<p>Ask any 90's kid and this one is going to top the list. The movie that redifend mass moments and shattered all box office records</p>
